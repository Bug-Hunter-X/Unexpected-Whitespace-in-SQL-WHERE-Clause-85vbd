# SQL Query Bug: Unexpected Whitespace
This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in SQL queries involving string comparisons. The bug arises when the WHERE clause is used to filter data based on a column with leading or trailing whitespace. 

The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` demonstrates the fix. The issue and solution are detailed in the `bugContent` and `solutionContent` files.
